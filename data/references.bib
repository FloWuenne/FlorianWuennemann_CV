  abstract = "Summary Melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) frequently occurs in
              patients with advanced melanoma; yet, our understanding of the
              underlying salient biology is rudimentary. Here, we performed
              single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq in 22 treatment-naive MBMs and 10
              extracranial melanoma metastases (ECMs) and matched spatial
              single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor (TCR)-seq. Cancer
              cells from MBM were more chromosomally unstable, adopted a
              neuronal-like cell state, and enriched for spatially variably
              expressed metabolic pathways. Key observations were validated in
              independent patient cohorts, patient-derived MBM/ECM xenograft
              models, RNA/ATAC-seq, proteomics, and multiplexed imaging.
              Integrated spatial analyses revealed distinct geography of
              putative cancer immune evasion and evidence for more abundant
              intra-tumoral B to plasma cell differentiation in lymphoid
              aggregates in MBM. MBM harbored larger fractions of
              monocyte-derived macrophages and dysfunctional TOX+CD8+ T cells
              with distinct expression of immune checkpoints. This work
              provides comprehensive insights into MBM biology and serves as a
              foundational resource for further discovery and therapeutic
              exploration.",
